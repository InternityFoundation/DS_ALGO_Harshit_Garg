Title of Project - Encryption/Decryption Tool

Description- In this project, a ciphering and deciphering tool by using different ciphering algorithms is implemented(hill cipher, rail fence cipher)
The user needs to input the message and the key.Message is encoded by first coding it by hill cipher and the result obtained by hill cipher 
will be again encoded by rail fence ciphering algorithm and we will have the final result.

Algorithm Used- Hill Cipher & Rail Fence Cipher Algorithms

Examples for Hill Cipher:

Input  : Plaintext: ACT
         Key: GYBNQKURP
Output : Ciphertext: POH
Input  : Plaintext: GFG
         Key: HILLMAGIC 
Output : Ciphertext: SWK


Examples for Rail Fence Cipher:
Encryption
Input :  "defend the east wall"
Key = 3
Output : dnhaweedtees alf  tl
Decryption
Input : dnhaweedtees alf  tl
Key = 3
Output : defend the east wall

Encryption
Input : "attack at once"
Key = 2 
Output : atc toctaka ne 
Decryption
Input : "atc toctaka ne"
Key = 2
Output : attack at once
